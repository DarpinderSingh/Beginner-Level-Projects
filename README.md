#1. C++ Console Menu Application with List Management
This project is a C++ console application demonstrating menu-driven interaction and list manipulation. The program lets users add elements to a list, display the list, and potentially other functionalities.
Key C++ constructs include:
do-while loops: The main menu loop uses a do-while structure to ensure the menu displays at least once. It continues until a specific exit condition is met, typically when the user selects an "exit" option.
switch: Conditional logic uses switch statements to process user input and direct the program's flow to the correct function based on the selected menu option.
std::vector: A dynamic array, or std::vector, stores and manages the list of items. This allows the list to grow or shrink as elements are added or removed during program execution.
This project applies fundamental C++ programming principles to create a functional and interactive console-based utility. It demonstrates how these basic concepts can combine to build an application.
